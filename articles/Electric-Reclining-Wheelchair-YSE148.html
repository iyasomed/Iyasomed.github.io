    <p class="meta-info">Published on: 2026-1-23 | Author: Iyasocare</p>

    <p>Finding the right wheelchair can be a game-changer, especially for individuals who rely on mobility devices for their daily activities. The YSE148 <strong><a href="https://www.iyasomed.com/products/electric-reclining-wheelchair-yse148/" target="_blank">Electric Reclining Wheelchair</a></strong> is designed with both comfort and practicality in mind, offering a wide range of features that make life easier, whether you're at home or on the go.</p>

    <h3>Hydraulic Reclining Design for Maximum Comfort</h3>
    <p>One of the standout features of the YSE148 Electric Wheelchair is its hydraulic reclining system. This allows users to adjust the angle of the seat, so you can easily switch between sitting, reclining, or lying down, based on your comfort level. Whether you're resting after a long day or simply want to change positions, this reclining function makes it easy to do so without any hassle.</p>
    <p>In addition to reclining, the wheelchair comes with adjustable armrests and footrests, offering greater flexibility for people of various body types. The pedal adjustment feature also allows users to fine-tune the leg support for maximum comfort, ensuring that every journey is as comfortable as possible.</p>

    <h3>Easy-to-Remove Quick-Release Battery</h3>
    <p>When it comes to electric wheelchairs, the battery is an essential component. The YSE148 makes battery maintenance simple with its quick-release battery design. This feature allows you to remove and replace the battery quickly without any tools, making charging or swapping out batteries on the go a breeze.</p>
    <p>The wheelchair offers two types of batteries:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>24V 12/20Ah lead-acid battery</li>
        <li>24V 6/13/20/30Ah lithium battery</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With a driving range of 10-25 km, the YSE148 ensures you have ample power to travel short to medium distances on a single charge, so you can enjoy more independence throughout the day.</p>

    <h3>Durable Steel Frame and Superior Mobility</h3>
    <p>Built with a steel frame, the YSE148 is designed for durability and strength, supporting users up to 120 kg. This robust frame provides a solid foundation, giving users the confidence they need for daily use.</p>
    <p>When it comes to mobility, the YSE148 features 12-inch rear wheels and 8-inch front wheels, ensuring smooth navigation over both indoor and outdoor surfaces. The 9° climbing ability further enhances its versatility, allowing you to tackle ramps or small inclines with ease.</p>

    <h3>Smart Control for Effortless Navigation</h3>
    <p>Navigating the YSE148 is made simple thanks to its user-friendly controls. The controller is adjustable both front-to-back and left-to-right, meaning it can be customized to suit your preferences, whether you’re left- or right-handed. The intuitive design ensures easy operation, even for those with limited hand strength or dexterity.</p>
    <p>Moreover, the electromagnetic brake system provides quick and reliable stopping power, ensuring safety at all times, whether you're on flat ground or navigating more challenging terrain.</p>

    <h3>Compact and Travel-Friendly</h3>
